# GenderSelect

We live in a progressive tolerant world and using a bigender system for your website is outdated.
For this reason, the GenderSelect plugin was developed by the best programmers with the support of open-source. 
Which allows your users to use more than 40+ genders (the list will be updated).

Example of the plugin working in a folder 'example'
